"""This file contains the critic classes.

A critic is an entity that analyzes something and issues complaints, or
critiques. Each complaint has a severity and metadata associated with it.
In the ideal world, the critics are always happy and they don't complain,
ever. In the real world, changes are made which upset the critics and they
get angry.

Critics exist to enforce best practices.
